  "accident decription": "A Google Lexus-model autonomous vehicle (\"Google AV\") was traveling in autonomous mode eastbound on EI Camino Real in Mountain\nView in the far right-hand lane approaching the Castro St. intersection. As the Google AV approached the intersection, it signaled its intent to make a right turn on red onto Castro St. The Google AV then moved to the right-hand side of the lane to pass traffic in the same lane that was stopped at the intersection and proceeding straight, However, the Google AV had to come to a stop and go around sandbags positioned around a storm drain that were blocking its path. When the light turned green, traffic in the lane continued past the Google AV. After a few cars had passed, the Google AV began to proceed back into the center of the lane to pass the sand bags. A public transit bus was\napproaching from behind. The Google AV test driver saw the bus approaching in the left side mirror but believed the bus would stop or\nslow to allow the Google AV to continue. Approximately three seconds later, as the Google AV was reentering the center of the lane it\nmade contact with the side of the bus. The Google AV was operating in autonomous mode and traveling at less than 2 mph, and the bus was\ntravelling at about 15 mph at the time of contact.\n\nThe Google AV sustained body damage to the left front fender, the left front wheel and one of its driver's-side sensors, There were no\ninjuries reported at the scene.",

The Cruise AV was traveling in the center of three one-way lanes.\nIdentifying a space between two vehicles (a minivan in front and a sedan behind) in the left lane, the Cruise AV began to merge into that\nlane. At the same time, the minivan decelerated. Sensing that its gap was closing, the Cruise AV stopped making its lane change and\nreturned fully to the center lane. As the Cruise AV was re-centering itself in the lane, a motorcycle that that had just lane-split between two vehicles in the center and right lanes moved into the center lane, glanced the side of the Cruise AV, wobbled, and fell over. At the time of the collision, the Cruise AV was traveling with the flow of traffic at 12mph, while the motorcycle was traveling at approximately 17mph.\nThe motorcyclist got up and walked his vehicle to the side of the road, where the parties exchanged information. 911 was called pursuant to\nCruise policy. The motorcyclist reported shoulder pain and was taken to receive medical care, and a police report was taken.\n\nAs reported in Traffic Collision Report #170989746, the motorcyclist was determined to be at fault for attempting to overtake and pass\nanother vehicle on the right under conditions that did not permit that movement in safety in violation of CVC 21755(a).",

The Pony AV's safety driver disengaged autonomous mode, observed that there were no vehicles directly behind it, and reversed 20-30 feet as a precaution. When the traffic light turned green, Vehicle 2 accelerated while still in reverse toward the Pony AV.  Vehicle 2 came to a complete stop about 4 feet from the Pony AV's front bumper. After about 2 seconds, however, Vehicle 2 continued to reverse in the direction of the Pony AV, resulting in contact between the two vehicles. The contact caused minor scratches to both vehicles. The Pony AV's safety driver and the driver of Vehicle 2 pulled over at a nearby parking lot and exchanged information. There were no injuries reported and the police were not called.",

The driver of the autonomous vehicle applied normal braking force to come to a stop. Shortly thereafter, the autonomous test vehicle was rear-ended by a Honda-CRV. No major bodily injuries were reported from either party in the crash. Damage to the autonomous vehicle was minor; the car had small scratches. The Honda-CRV's driver airbag was deployed and the front bumper of the car was partially handing out of the car's body frame. Drivers from both parties exchanged information and took pictures of the damage. The passenger of the autonomous test vehicle contacted 911 approximately at 10:05 AM and requested a CHP officer on scene. The CHP officer arrived approximately 45 minutes after the initial call and took down a report. After both parties had exchanged information, the office dismissed both parties. The Aimotive vehicle was driven manually back to the office.   ",

In this location there are traffic pylons on the left edge of the leftmost lane that separate this lane from the municipal tram line that operates in the median of 3rd Street. As the Waymo AV approached the intersection, a San Francisco MUNI city bus traveling at approximately 40 MPH in the right adjacent lane began to overtake the Waymo AV from the right, while moving toward the Waymo’s lane of travel. Due to the encroaching city bus and the pylons on the left edge of the Waymo AV’s lane, the Waymo AV began to brake. The Waymo AV test driver disengaged autonomous mode and took control of the Waymo AV. Approximately 1 second later, the passenger vehicle behind the Waymo AV made contact with the Waymo AV’s rear bumper at approximately 27 MPH. The Waymo AV was traveling approximately 4 MPH.

The Pony.ai AV was stopped at 0 mph, while the approximate speed of Vehicle 2 at the point of collision was 5 mph. The Pony.ai AV operator noted that prior to the collision, the driver of Vehicle 2 appeared to drive erratically across other intersections as well. The contact between the vehicles caused a moderate damage to the back of the Pony.ai AV and moderate damage to Vehicle 2. Both drivers pulled over to the side of the roadway and exchanged information. There were no injuries reported and the police were not called. Pursuant to protocol, Pony.ai ran simulations after the accident to determine if the ADV would have reacted differently. The results indicate the Pony.ai ADV would not have reacted differently. ",

The Waymo AV test driver was traveling approximately 15 MPH and then gradually slowed and came to a stop for a passenger vehicle in its lane making a right turn onto Ellis Street. A cyclist following the Waymo AV at approximately 19 MPH then attempted to pass the Waymo AV on the left side and travel between the Waymo AV’s driver’s side and a faster-moving passenger vehicle in the left adjacent lane. As the cyclist attempted to overtake the Waymo AV and was in turn being overtaken by the adjacent passenger vehicle, the cyclist fell between the two vehicles. As the bicycle was falling, the bicycle’s front tire appears to have made contact with the rear driver’s side wheel of the Waymo AV, and the cyclist appears to have made contact with the side of the other passenger vehicle in the left adjacent lane. The Waymo AV sustained no damage. The passenger vehicle did not stop and left the scene. The cyclist was transported from the scene and reportedly treated for potential head injuries.\r",

The Waymo AV was initially traveling eastbound on McAllister Street in autonomous mode, approaching the intersection at Larkin Street. When the Waymo AV reached the near-side crosswalk in the dedicated left turn lane, it came to a complete stop at the red traffic light. When the traffic light turned green, the Waymo AV moved forward slightly, partially entering the crosswalk, to begin staging for the turn, yielding to oncoming traffic and other road users. While waiting for an adequate clearance in traffic, the traffic light turned yellow. The Waymo AV remained stopped, declining to proceed into the intersection and make the left turn. While the AV was still stopped, the test driver took over manual control and proceeded to make the left turn. About 4 seconds later, the manually driven Waymo AV made contact with an individual riding a motorized scooter who had entered the crosswalk from the sidewalk at about 10 MPH against both vehicle and pedestrian traffic signals. The motorized scooter was traveling about 6 MPH and the Waymo AV was traveling about 7 MPH at the time of contact. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its front license plate.

While proceeding straight down First street, a car parallel to our vehicle initiated a sudden lane change and began moving towards our vehicle from the bus only lane at about 10 MPH. At this point, our driver held the horn down and applied the brakes.  Our driver was unable to avoid the other vehicle due to the limited amount of space between our vehicle and the other vehicle, and the side curb to the left. At this time the car was struck; collision was unavoidable. During this time, our driver was approached by the occupants of the vehicle and information was exchanged. They said they were going to back up into the parking lot as security said they couldn't stop there. Our driver attempted to back up but due to a grinding noise, stopped. At this point our driver went to continue to get information but the occupants walked off and he couldn't abandon the vehicle.  There was moderate damage to our vehicle on the front bumper and passenger side wheel well in the form of deep dents and a small portion of the passenger side front bumper detached.  The glass covering the passenger side headlight was damaged as well.  The other vehicle sustained minor damage on the driver side front wheel well in the form of dents. ",

The test vehicle operators believed they had run over road debris and did not discover the crash or damage until after returning to base, so the two vehicles did not exchange information. No injuries were reported, and law enforcement was not called to the scene.",

The Zoox vehicle was slowing and moving at approximately 2 mph with its brake lamps and left turn indicator illuminated, yielding to an oncoming vehicle with the right of way. A following vehicle - traveling at approximately 24 mph - then struck the Zoox vehicle's right rear bumper, and that vehicle's driver airbag appeared to have deployed on impact. The Zoox operator disengaged autonomy, proceeded with the left turn, and pulled over. The following vehicle continued its path of travel, veered out of the lane, and collided with a tree on the left side of the road. The Menlo Park Police Department was called to the scene. Two Zoox operators sustained minor injuries and it is unknown if the driver of the other vehicle sustained injuries.",

The vehicle’s ADS determined that a truck traveling in the adjacent lane had a trajectory towards the Drive Pilot’s lane, and so the Mercedes-Benz test vehicle autonomously applied the brakes to avoid a collision.  After applying the brakes and bringing itself to a standstill, the Mercedes-Benz was then struck in the rear bumper by a trailing semi-truck that did not stop in time.  No injuries were reported, no airbags deployed in either vehicle, and both vehicles were able to be driven from the scene of the incident. The Mercedes-Benz vehicle experienced minor damage to the rear bumper, and no damage was observed on the semi-truck at the scene. The CA Traffic Collision Report for the subject incident noted a violation of California Vehicle Code 22350 (unsafe speed for traffic conditions) by the semi-truck in the #2 lane that struck the rear bumper of the Mercedes-Benz.

After a brief interaction during which the driver of the passenger vehicle threatened Pony.ai employees, the passenger vehicle and driver drove away.

The Ghost car was traveling in AV mode with a registered AV Test Driver behind the wheel and an additional Safety Co-Driver in the passenger seat. Traffic slowed quickly due to a crash ahead of the Ghost car. Consistent with their training, the Ghost driver took control by braking and disengaging the autonomous system. The Ghost car stopped without impacting the preceding car. A Mercedes car immediately following the Ghost car also came to a stop without impacting the Ghost car. Ghost's understanding based on communications at the scene is that a Grand Cherokee traveling behind the Mercedes tried to swerve to avoid impacting the Mercedes but clipped the Mercedes and rolled over. To Ghost's knowledge, nobody in the Grand Cherokee was injured. The Ghost drivers heard a noise and then found that the rear bumper of the Ghost car had been damaged, which Ghost believes resulted from crash debris. The Ghost drivers drove the Ghost car back to the garage in conventional mode. ",

Traffic was moving in all four lanes at or near the speed limit. The Ghost vehicle was in the right-middle lane. Another vehicle (the \"lead\" car) entered into the Ghost car's lane from the right. While there were numerous vehicles ahead of the Ghost car before that vehicle entered the lane, the lead vehicle blocked the view of the lane before it. Throughout the incident, traffic in the other three lanes continued at a steady pace. When the lead vehicle entered into the lane ahead of the Ghost car, the Ghost car applied the brakes to accommodate the intrusion and then continued to match the speed of the lead car. The lead car suddenly slammed the brakes. The Ghost car followed suit, reducing its speed from 19 mps (42.5 mph) to 4.7 mps (10.5 mph) within the next three seconds. The Ghost car was able to match the rapid speed reduction of the lead car and avoid contact. The driver following the Ghost car was not able to respond as quickly as the Ghost ADS. When the following driver began to apply the brakes, the car was about five meters behind and was traveling at 6.5 mps. At the point of impact, the Ghost vehicle was traveling at 4.78 mps (10.7 mph), matching the lead car. There were no injuries. The vehicles suffered only cosmetic damage, the drivers exchanged information, and the Ghost safety drivers returned to home base in conventional mode.",

While the Waymo AV remained stopped, an SUV approached the Waymo AV from behind and partially entered the oncoming lanes of W. Jefferson Boulevard to maneuver around the Waymo AV and proceed into the dedicated left turn lane. As the SUV was passing the stopped Waymo AV, the passenger side of the SUV made contact with the rear driver side corner of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage and the SUV left the scene.",
